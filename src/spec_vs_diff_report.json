  "summary": "Core Valentine prompt/success single-page UI is implemented with an evasive “No” button (hover + pointer down) and a “Yes” click that reveals a local meme image and the required message. However, the exact button labeling and required static asset file presence are not evidenced, and several unrequested authentication/backend-related features were added (Internet Identity hooks, actor creation, backend canister stub), plus an external link in the footer.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "On load, the page shows a single clear prompt asking to be the Valentine and displays exactly two options labeled “Yes” and “No”.",
      "reason": "The “Yes” option is not labeled exactly “Yes”; it is rendered as “Yes! 💕”, so the AC about labels is not met as written.",

      "description": "Added Internet Identity authentication provider/hook and actor creation logic (client auth + identity-based actor), which is explicitly a non-goal (no third-party auth providers).",
